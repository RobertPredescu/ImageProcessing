Description:
The Java Image Rotator project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to rotate BMP images at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. It emphasizes robust error handling, encapsulation, and code organization, providing a comprehensive example of image manipulation.

Features:

Image Rotation: Rotate BMP images at 90, 180, and 270 degrees with precision and efficiency.
Object-Oriented Approach: Employ OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance to ensure code modularity and scalability.
Exception Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and unexpected scenarios.
File I/O Handling: Ensure reliable file input/output operations for reading BMP images and saving rotated images.
User Interaction: Provide a user-friendly interface for specifying image file paths and rotation angles.
Implementation Details:

Image Handling:
Utilize Java's standard libraries to read BMP images and manipulate pixel data.
Implement a dedicated BMPImage class to encapsulate image-related operations.
Rotation Algorithms:
Implement rotation algorithms for 90, 180, and 270-degree rotations with careful consideration for accuracy and performance.
Modular design allows easy extension for additional rotation angles in the future.
Main Class:
Orchestrate the image rotation process based on user input.
Utilize the ImageRotator class to perform rotation operations.
Exception Handling:
Handle various exceptions, including invalid user input, file I/O errors, and unexpected runtime exceptions.
Utilize try-catch blocks and exception propagation to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to the user
